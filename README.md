Created for the Manchester Girl Geeks May 2015 [Mini Barcamp] event. 

_Manchester Girl Geeks_ is a not-for-profit group which organises networking
events, talks and hands-on workshops for women and girls with an interest in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). For more information

[BarCamp] is an international network of conferences primarily focused around
technology and the web. It's a lot like [FooCamp] but more open to the public. 
Foo Camp is an annual _unconference_ hosted by O'Reilly Media. An unconference
is an informal, more ad-hoc version of a _conference_. A conference is an
_event_ with talks and stuff. An event is a _thing_ that _happens_.
